# Type Mismatch Errors Prevention

## Error Summary:
- The compiler error occurred when trying to use pgtype.Int4 struct where int32 was expected
- This happened in the db.CreateMatchParams initialization and API response mapping
- The error message was: "cannot use pgtype.Int4{...} as int32 value in struct literal"

## Best Practices:
- Always verify the expected types in struct definitions before assignment
- When working with database models, check if fields are primitive types or custom types
- For pgtype fields, use the .Int32 field to extract the underlying value when needed
- Maintain consistency between database model types and API response types
- When modifying auto-generated files, consider the impact on dependent code

## Prevention Checklist:
- [ ] Verify struct field types before assignment
- [ ] Check for type mismatches between database models and API contracts
- [ ] Test type conversions thoroughly
- [ ] Document any necessary type conversions

# Batch Update Implementation Challenges

## Error Summary:
- Field naming inconsistencies between API and DB models (Winnerid vs WinnerId)
- Missing expected fields in DbMatch struct
- Null pointer dereferencing risks
- Type conversion between API and database models

## Best Practices:
- Verify struct field definitions before accessing
- Match database field names exactly (case-sensitive)
- Use pgtype wrappers for nullable fields
- Validate pointer fields before dereferencing
- Implement proper error handling for batch operations

## Prevention Checklist:
- [ ] Verify all struct field names match exactly
- [ ] Check for missing fields in API contracts
- [ ] Handle nullable fields with pgtype conversion
- [ ] Validate pointer fields before access
- [ ] Implement batch operation error handling
